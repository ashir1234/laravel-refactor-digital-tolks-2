### Important note
- I completely forgot to add the two commits. I only added 1 commit with the fully refactored code. But key points that i've refactored are mentioned below. REVIEW & THOUGHTS are given at the end. THANKS.

### Improvements in BookingController.php

- Imported necessary classes for improved code readability.
- Removed unnecessary comments to enhance code cleanliness and maintainability.
- Used Laravel's `response()->json()` method to return JSON responses for better consistency in API output.
- Handled unauthorized access cases in the `index` method with a proper response.
- Updated the `show` method to use `findWith` instead of `with` to fetch related data more efficiently.
- Modified `getHistory` to return a proper response in case of invalid requests, providing better error handling.
- Simplified the logic for handling optional parameters in the `distanceFeed` method, leading to cleaner and more concise code.

### Improvements in BookingRepository.php

- Enhanced code readability by adding appropriate comments and organizing code blocks.
- Refactored the `updateJob` method to improve code structure and maintainability.
- Reorganized the `changeStatus`, `changeTimedoutStatus`, `changeCompletedStatus`, `changeStartedStatus`, `changePendingStatus`, `changeWithdrawafter24Status`, and `changeAssignedStatus` methods to follow a consistent and concise structure.
- Created a separate method `changeTranslator` to handle changes in the translator, improving code modularity and reducing redundancy.
- Refactored the `changeDue` method to handle date changes more efficiently.
- Extracted the temporary method `sendSessionStartRemindNotification` into a separate service for better code organization.
- Improved error handling and response messages in various methods for more robust API behavior.
- Reorganized the `cancelJobAjax` method for better readability and structured flow.
- Simplified conditional checks and data processing in the `cancelJobAjax` method to make the code more concise and clear.
- Removed unused or redundant code and variables to optimize the codebase.



# Test for `willExpireAt` method in TeHelper class

## Description
The `willExpireAt` method in the `TeHelper` class is responsible for calculating the expiration time of a job based on its due time and creation time. This method is used to determine when a job will expire and needs to be completed. The test ensures that the method correctly calculates the expiration time and returns a `Carbon` instance representing the calculated time.

## Test Case
The test case involves the following steps:
1. Create a mock due time and creation time for a job.
2. Call the `willExpireAt` method with the mock due time and creation time.
3. Assert that the method returns a `Carbon` instance.
4. Assert that the returned `Carbon` instance represents the correct expiration time based on the given due time and creation time.

## Run Test
Please run `php artisan test` to run the test

## Test Method
```php
use Tests\TestCase;
use App\Helpers\TeHelper;
use Carbon\Carbon;

class TeHelperTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testWillExpireAt()
    {
        // Create mock due time and creation time
        $dueTime = Carbon::now()->addHours(20);
        $createdAt = Carbon::now();

        // Call the method under test
        $result = TeHelper::willExpireAt($dueTime, $createdAt);

        // Assert the result
        $this->assertInstanceOf(Carbon::class, $result);
        $this->assertEquals($dueTime, $result);
    }
}
```
### Thoughts about the Code

The provided codebase demonstrates some good practices and solid logic, but there are also areas that could be improved. Here are the key points:

- **Good Code**
  - The code follows the Laravel framework conventions, enhancing maintainability and collaboration.
  - Meaningful variable and method names improve code readability and understanding.
  - Dividing functionality into different classes and methods adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and enhances modularity.
  - Usage of Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions provides a clean and efficient approach to handle database operations.
  - Comments are present, which helps in understanding the purpose of methods and functions.

- **Areas of Improvement**
  - Some methods are quite lengthy and could benefit from further refactoring into smaller, more focused functions.
  - Certain comments could be improved by providing more context or explaining complex logic in greater detail.
  - Test coverage could be expanded to cover more edge cases and ensure comprehensive testing of the codebase.

### Refactoring Approach

To improve the codebase, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Extract Complex Logic into Smaller Functions**
   - Identify lengthy methods with complex logic and refactor them into smaller functions, each with a specific responsibility.
   - This will improve code readability, maintainability, and adherence to the Single Responsibility Principle.

2. **Enhance Comments**
   - Review existing comments and add more descriptive comments where necessary, providing additional context and explanations for complex logic.
   - Well-documented code is easier for other developers to understand and maintain.

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add explicit error handling in critical parts of the code, such as database interactions and external API calls.
   - Proper error handling will prevent unexpected crashes and improve the code's robustness.

4. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Write additional test cases to cover more scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
   - Comprehensive test coverage ensures that the code functions correctly in all situations.

5. **Consistent Code Formatting**
   - Review the code for consistent indentation, code alignment, and naming conventions.
   - Consistency in formatting enhances code readability and makes it easier to maintain.

6. **Leverage Laravel Features**
   - Utilize more Laravel features, such as Eloquent relationships, query scopes, and helper functions, to simplify code and improve performance.

By implementing these refactoring steps, the codebase will become even more maintainable, robust, and easier to collaborate on by the development team.

Please note that the above refactoring steps are just suggestions based on my review of the code. The actual refactoring approach may vary depending on specific project requirements and considerations.
